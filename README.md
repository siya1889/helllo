Create a new GitHub repository.
Clone the repository and make changes locally, making sure to include an index.html file which will be the landing page for your website.
Push those changes to GitHub.
Navigate to the Settings page of your repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages, and choose the master branch in the dropdown menu.
Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages part of the settings page, and after a few minutes, you should see a notification that “Your site is published at: …” including a URL where you can find your site!
That’s all for this lecture! Next time, we’ll be looking at Python!
